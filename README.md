## SpendETH Contract


The SpendETH Contract is an Ethereum smart contract designed to forward any received Ether (ETH) to a predefined recipient address. The recipient address can also be updated dynamically. Built with Foundry, this project ensures a robust and gas-efficient solution for ETH forwarding.

## üöÄ Features

Automatically forwards received ETH to a specified recipient.
Allows updating the recipient address securely.
Includes comprehensive error handling for invalid transactions or recipients.
Fully tested using Foundry's testing framework.

 
## üåü Prerequisites
Before you proceed, ensure you have the following installed:

Foundry: Follow the installation guide.
Node.js (optional, if integrating with frontend projects).
Git for cloning the repository.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mosnyik/spend.git
cd spendeth

```

2. Install Foundry:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```


## üíª Usage
1. Build the Project

Compile the smart contract:

```bash

forge build

```

2. Run Tests
Run the test suite to ensure the contract functions as expected:

```bash
forge test
```

3. Deploy the Contract
Start a local Ethereum node using Anvil:

```bash
anvil
```
Deploy the contract using Foundry's scripting tool:


```bash
forge script script/SpendETH.s.sol:SpendETHScript --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key <your_private_key>
```

Replace <your_private_key> with the private key of the account you want to deploy the contract with.


## ü§ù Interacting with the Contract
### Send ETH
To send ETH to the contract, simply transfer Ether to the deployed contract's address. It will automatically forward the ETH to the predefined recipient.

### Update Recipient
Call the updateRecipient function to change the recipient:

```bash
contract.updateRecipient("0xNewRecipientAddress");

```
### Gas Snapshots
To generate a gas report:

```bash
forge snapshot
```

## Helpful Foundary Commands
#### Formatting Code
```bash
forge fmt
```
#### Start Local Node
```bash
anvil
```
#### Casting Commands
Use cast to interact with the blockchain directly:

```bash
cast send <contract_address> "updateRecipient(address)" <new_recipient_address>
```
